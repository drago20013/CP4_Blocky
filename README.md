### Description
My first time in the graphical programming. I could do better here with design patterns and general code quality, but I was more focused on learning new technologies. Time for this project was limited and finally I didn't optimize it well. Definetelly worth going back, and doing refactor.

### What I learned
* Basics of OpenGL API
* How rendering pipeline works
* How to create simple renderer, camera etc.
* How to abstract OpenGL to classes
* Managing vertex data at the level of bits (3 bits for x position component etc.)
